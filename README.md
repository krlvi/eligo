# eligo

the app allows to collaborate on arbitrary lists and randomly pick items from those lists.
we use it on a daily basis to decide where to get lunch at.

random is _actually_ random, using numbers generated by a quantum computer at [ANU QRNG][].

## architecture

- [protocol](./protocol/) contains definitions of types and functions shared between frontend and backend.
- [state](./state/) contains definitions of all possible events and a reducer to reduce event log into state.
- [app](./app/) is a [sveltekit][] app that is both backend and frontend
- [server](./server/) contains code server-side only code that is shared between the [sveltekit app](./src/app) and a [socket.io][] backend,
  that [runs in the same process](./app/server.js)

## development

make sure [mkcert][] is installed, it's required for local ssl.

then, just run:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

local database will be created as [./backend/database.dev.jsonl](./database.dev.jsonl).

## deployment

the app is hosted on [fly.io][] and can be deployed by running

```sh
fly deploy
```

from the root directory. It's is also automatically deployed for every new commit in master to

[sveltekit]: https://sveltekit.io/
