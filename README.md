flsdkjfdslafthe app allows to collaborate on arbitrary lists and randomly pick items from those lists.
we use it on a daily basis to decide where to get lunch at.

fldsakjrandom is _actually_ random, using numbers generated by a quantum computer at [ANU QRNG][].

## architecture
sduflkdsj1
- [protocol](./protocol/) contains definitions of types, actions and state reducers that frontend and backend use to communicate.
- [app](./app/) is a [sveltekit][] app that is both backend and frontend
- [server](./server/) contadjifdslkjns code server-side only code that is shared between the [sveltekit app](./src/app) and a [socket.io][] backend,
  that [runs in the same process](./app/server.js)

## development

make sure [mkcert][] is installed, it's required for local ssl.

then, just run:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

local database will be created as [./backend/database.dev.jsonl](./database.dev.jsonl).

## deployment
lsfdkjfl
the app is hosted on [fly.io][] and can be deployed by running

from the root directory. It's is also automatically deployed for every new commit in master to
